# show-logger

A personal website to track TV Shows and Movies that I watch on a daily basis. This is developed in .Net Core 6.0.

Features:
 - Easily add the next episode of a show with a single click of a button.
 - Track A-list membership vs the cost savings.
 - Add a friend and see what they are watching.
 - Add a show to the watchlist so it can be watched at a later time.
 - A seperate area to log books.
 - See stats for the year of the shows you've watched and books you've read.
