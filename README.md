# show-logger

A personal website to track TV Shows and Movies that I watch on a daily basis. This is developed in .Net Core 6.0.

Features:
 - Easily add the next episode of a show with a single click of a button.
 - Track A-list membership vs the cost savings.
 - Add a friend and see what they are watching.
 - Add a show to the watchlist so it can be watched at a later time.
 - A seperate area to log books.
 - See stats for the year of the shows you've watched and books you've read.
 
 I am using:
  - MVC Nonfactors Grid https://aspnet-core-grid.azurewebsites.net/
    - I added some custom javascript to allow for some form editors for data in the grid.
  - Font Awesome
  - Created a Tab control to load pages on demand when Tab is active.
 
You can create your own account here: https://show-logger.oaprojects.net/
Once you have set up your account, you can go to the shows area or the books area. 
You can click the button at the bottom to set your default area to load.
